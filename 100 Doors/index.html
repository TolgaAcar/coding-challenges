		<div class="problem-explanation explanation">
			There are 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed. You make
			100 passes by the doors. The first time through, visit every door
			and 'toggle' the door (if the door is closed, open it; if it is
			open, close it). The second time, only visit every 2nd door (i.e.,
			door #2, #4, #6, ...) and toggle it. The third time, visit every 3rd
			door (i.e., door #3, #6, #9, ...), etc., until you only visit the
			100th door.
		</div>
		<hr />
		<div class="solution-explanation explanation">
			Implement a function to determine the state of the doors after the
			last pass. Return the final result in an array, with only the door
			number included in the array if it is open.
